feat: implement database partitioning for high-volume scaling

Implement time-based partitioning for the transactions table to handle
millions of records efficiently using PostgreSQL 14+ native range partitioning.

Changes:
- Convert transactions table to partitioned table (monthly by created_at)
- Add PartitionManager with automated maintenance (24-hour interval)
- Create partition management functions (create/detach/maintain)
- Implement 12-month retention policy with automatic detachment
- Add comprehensive documentation and SQL utilities
- Include monitoring queries and archival strategies

Technical Details:
- Partitioning: Range by created_at (monthly intervals)
- Naming: transactions_y{YYYY}m{MM} (e.g., transactions_y2025m02)
- Retention: 12 months (configurable)
- Maintenance: Automated background task every 24 hours
- Primary Key: Changed to composite (id, created_at)
- Migration: Non-destructive (preserves transactions_old)

Files Added:
- migrations/20250217000000_partition_transactions.sql
- migrations/partition_utils.sql
- src/db/partition.rs
- docs/partitioning.md
- PR_DESCRIPTION.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- PARTITION_QUICK_REF.md

Files Modified:
- src/main.rs (initialize partition manager)
- src/db/mod.rs (export partition module)
- README.md (add partitioning section)
- Cargo.toml (fix duplicate dependency)

Benefits:
- Improved query performance via partition pruning
- Faster VACUUM and maintenance operations
- Easy archival of old data by detaching partitions
- Scalable to millions of records without degradation
- Zero downtime partition management

Requirements:
- PostgreSQL 14+ (native declarative partitioning)
- No external dependencies (pg_partman not required)

Testing:
- Verified migration creates 3 initial partitions
- Tested partition functions (create/detach/maintain)
- Confirmed background task initialization
- Validated data insertion to correct partitions
- Tested rollback procedure

Resolves #16
